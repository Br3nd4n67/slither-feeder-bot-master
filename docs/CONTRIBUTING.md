# Contributing
First of all, I want to say thank you for taking the time to improve this project.

## Bugs/Fixes/Features

If you happen to find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please create a detailed issue for it. If you are reporting a bug, please include the steps to reproduce the problem.

## Submitting Code

1. Make sure you have read the [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) guide
2. Create an issue explaining what you have changed, deleted, or added
3. Please submit your code in a new branch and *not master*
4. Create a pull request for merging that branch into master


### Tips

* Do not use issues as a chat unless it's for discussion. If you would like to talk please head over to the gitter
* Please do not submit code saying who created it in the commit log or any type of credits (Your name is already included in the log)
